## Contribution guide

### Peer-to-peer in a server-client world
This application is built upon two main libraries [SocketIO](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io) and [PeerJS](https://github.com/peers/peerjs). PeerJS is served as peer-to-peer communication and socketIO is served as signaling server (at the current time, socketIO also servers messaging feature).

- PeerJS provides a complete, configurable and easy-to-use API build on top of WebRTC, supporting both data chanenels and media streams.
- Socket.IO enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication.
